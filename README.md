## Here is why I Midly Despise The HTML Syntax

HTML's xml syntax and it being forgiving and not mad strict like other xml based formats
makes it approachable and fun to use. It's tags make it easy to use, the way we can add
data and more,  all I sayno one can hate on it.

Here is why I midly despise it, it is so easy to get lost in a file where XML tags are
literd everywhere, I know you can use Control F or Control G your way, however there is
JavaScript.

Okay, SEO is not a concern if you are building a Single Page App, so calling ui
from js will be much more ease of use.
